      <p class="homedet">The importance of controlling diatomic molecules is growing in chemical physics, owing to their applications in quantum information, ultracold chemistry, and the study of physics beyond the standard model. The majority of these applications rely on laser cooling and trapping techniques, which have been achieved for a few molecules. These techniques are suitable for molecules showing almost vertical Franck-Condon factors (FCF's), which depend directly on the spectroscopic constants of the ground and excited states. Thereby, developing a database with the spectroscopic constants as well as Franck-Condon information will help the research to target the perfect candidates for molecular laser cooling.

      <h1 class="hometitle">Projects </h1>
      <p class="homedet">The project aims to make available the spectroscopic constants for diatomic molecules taken from Huber and Herzberg's book 1 as well as Franck-Condon factors (relevant for laser cooling of molecules) to the users, from students to researchers, in a friendly and completely interactive way. Friendly because the user can straightforwardly retrieve spectroscopic data of diatomic molecules in a variety of formats compatible with analyzing software. The user, after registration, has the possibility of uploading new spectroscopic data. Therefore the project prompts the field of molecular spectroscopy through the information era paradigm that we live these days. The project has been developed under the open-access philosophy promoted by the Max Planck Society. Finally, we would like to emphasize that having more data helps to better understand the underlying quantum mechanical nature behind the scene of molecules.
